# Quick Deploy - Start Here! ðŸš€

Your code is ready to deploy! Follow these simple steps:

## Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

### Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub: https://github.com/new
# Name it: prague-family-events
# Keep it public or private (your choice)
# DON'T initialize with README (we already have one)

# Then run these commands in your terminal:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/prague-family-events.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Deploy Backend to Railway

1. **Go to**: https://railway.app/new
2. **Click**: "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. **Select**: `prague-family-events`
4. **Configure**:
   - Root Directory: `backend`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
5. **Add PostgreSQL**:
   - Click "+ New" â†’ "Database" â†’ "PostgreSQL"
6. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=<from Railway PostgreSQL>
   NODE_ENV=production
   PORT=3001
   FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=fc-7b5a295a433c43aaa4bc2df621a20aeb
   ENABLE_CRON=true
   SCRAPER_DELAY_MS=2000
   ```
7. **Run Migrations**:
   - Open Railway shell
   - Run: `npx prisma migrate deploy`
   - Run: `npx prisma db seed`

8. **Copy the Railway URL** (looks like: `https://xxx.up.railway.app`)

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend to Vercel

1. **Go to**: https://vercel.com/new
2. **Import**: Your GitHub repository
3. **Configure**:
   - Framework: Next.js
   - Root Directory: `frontend`
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
4. **Add Environment Variable**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-railway-url>
   ```
5. **Click Deploy**

6. **Go back to Railway** and add:
   ```
   FRONTEND_URL=<your-vercel-url>
   ```

### Step 4: Test Your Site! ðŸŽ‰

Visit your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://prague-family-events.vercel.app`)

You should see:
- âœ… 50+ family events from Prague
- âœ… Interactive map
- âœ… Filtering by age, category, date
- âœ… Event details with booking links

## Option 2: Deploy with Vercel CLI (Advanced)

### Install Vercel CLI:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

### Deploy Frontend:
```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### Deploy Backend:
Use Railway as described above (Vercel serverless functions don't support cron jobs well)

---

## Troubleshooting

### Frontend shows "Failed to fetch events"
**Fix**: Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in Vercel matches your Railway backend URL

### Backend shows CORS errors
**Fix**: Check `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway matches your Vercel frontend URL

### No events showing
**Fix**:
1. Check Railway logs
2. Run scraper manually in Railway shell: `npm run scrape`
3. Check if DATABASE_URL is set correctly
